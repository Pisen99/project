## Design

### Imagery
      I wanted the whole page to have one common thread.
      The green in the main image goes well togheter with the other colors on the page.
      The cover-text matching the backround color (#fffaf1), the green in the image matching the menu when you hover over it.
### Dining
      images has a thin line of a green frame around them matching the rest of the text in the website.
      
### Color Scheme
      I used three colors when building the website, #fffaf1, #54655A and #80BA4D.
      
### Typography
      I wanted to use a fun font for my header, h1/h2´s and a more serious one for the text content in the rest of the page.
      The colors are soft to the eye and goes well togheter, matching the content of both summer and snow.
      
### Media query
      Making the website match on different tablets 320px, 768px and 3840px.
      I realised this practice i used was more complicated than I thought it would be.
      Unfortunatley I could not use flexbox since I didnt know how it worked.
      I realised to late that "@media screen and (max-width: ___px)" was to much for me.
